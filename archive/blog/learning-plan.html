          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            I’d like to find myself back in the IT sector, hopefully working in
            a technical role that I can use my people skills as an asset to
            strengthen the team and its relationships. I don’t have a particular
            destination in mind currently.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I know that my ability to work with others, break the ice and set a
            standard for interactions will be a massive strength toward how
            bootcamp goes for me. I worry that I need to keep my confidence in
            check so that I don’t overwhelm or overpower those around me,
            especially when I believe they’re likely to have stronger technical
            understanding than me.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’m worried about my ability to stay well focused for the next nine
            weeks, I’ve had a myriad of disruptions to foundations that have
            just been the worst timing that has unsettled my flow a little bit.
            I think I’m gaining that back and the move to bootcamp may be the
            break point I need to get that laser focus back.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’m really looking forward to continuing to work on my active
            listening skills, I think this is the weakest of my soft skills as I
            often find myself jumping starting to ponder solutions and my
            internal dialogue takes away from me being able to concentrate and
            listen intently to others. I’d really like to be able to remain
            present and expand on that capability without hurting my ability to
            empathise and problem solve with others.
          </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          <p>
            I hope they’re as great as they have been for foundations, the level
            of support and the kind hearted nature of the foundations team has
            set the bar pretty high for what I would hope interactions during
            bootcamp will look like.
          </p>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          <p>
            I think given the structured approach that bootcamp has, I think I
            will need to reach out for help sooner and let go of a lot of my
            stubbornness when it comes to poor solutions I’ve come up with to
            solve the challenges we’re presented with.
            <br />
            I am committed to keeping myself up to date with my work, to spend
            my own time to review and improve what I’ve learnt, to help others
            when they ask for it without hesitation, to listen to the experts
            and question things I don’t understand so that everyone gets through
            it.

          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>
            In the past my biggest challenge for career development in the IT
            sector was a lack of technical foundations. While I had the
            organisational and soft skills required to help me excel and
            translate technical information across teams using anecdotal
            metaphors I was weakest when encountering technical jargon and
            concepts. My long term goal is to be well positioned as a developer
            that excels in a technical aspect, my hope is that combining my
            innate soft skills I can be reach a senior position and effective
            leader.
          </p>
          <h2>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            Strengths: My strengths lie in my eye for detail, my problem solving
            skills and my work ethic. I have a good natural aptitude for
            learning and enjoy working hard. My eye for detail helps me notice
            mistakes as I make them and spot challenges/issues ahead of time and
            helps me stay focused on the task at hand. I enjoy solving problems
            and challenges and even create some for myself. Solving these
            problems teaches me more and reinforces that foundational
            information I’ve learnt. Limitations: One of my major strengths is
            also a weakness, as I can foresee problems ahead of time or
            understand challenges before they’re presented I often fixate on
            trying to solve those before completing the task at hand. This can
            be quite time consuming and become a distraction which actually
            weakens the understanding of what I’m trying to learn in the present
            because I’m too fixated on the future.
          </p>
          <h2>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I’d really like to grow my creativity and innovation skills, I often
            find that is where I struggle the most. I break down problems as
            logic quite often and so my solutions are generally the most direct
            path or the most efficient path and rarely something that is
            creative or new that could be the most enjoyable way to solve the
            problem.
          </p>
          <h2>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:
          </h2>
          <p>
            I will stick to my time plan and keep using time tracking tools to
            make sure I’m giving myself the breaks I need to stay focused on
            what I’m learning. I’m committed to being available and involved in
            the cohort discord and keeping an eye on how people are doing. I’ve
            been quick to ask for help when I’m feeling like I need a hint or a
            push and I have a fantastic support system in place outside of the
            course which has helped to keep the emotional pressure of the work
            from getting to me.
          </p>
          <h2>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I’m feeling lost and down the rabbit hole I will seek out help
            from my homegroup and facilitator. I can also discuss my challenges
            and the help I received/how I solved problems with my friends and
            family who are developers and IT professionals to strengthen my
            learning and understand more solutions.
          </p>
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          <p>
            My expectation is for a kind and involved team that is available to
            help and support.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h2>
          <p>
            My brother’s wedding is on the 16th March 2024 during bootcamp. I
            will need to plan around missing a day of focused study and work
            ahead of time for this.
