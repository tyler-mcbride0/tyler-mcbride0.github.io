        <h2>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I’ve definitely been reminded of what it's like to be out of my
          comfort zone during this experience. Its been awesome to be reflecting
          and taking note of myself again, in the past I did a lot of work on
          myself and for the last five or so years I’ve shelved a lot of the
          practices that I had in place like journaling and reflecting at the
          end of the day. I’ve learnt how much I enjoy those things, its helped
          settle my insecurities and quiet the voice in my head that makes me
          anxious about what I do, say and how I behave. <br />
          A main part of my daily reflections has been about taming my ego and
          my confidence to be within bounds. I've been able to reach out for
          help, let go of stubborn ideals to make things work how I want them to
          work and instead take on solutions presented to me. I’ve been aware of
          times I’ve felt negative about what I’m doing and let them rest
          instead of festering on my mind constantly due to being able to
          meditate and focus on my current project instead of regretting a
          mistake in a previous project.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          It's really important to understand why you’re doing what you’re doing
          and be able to relate that to the people around you. This is a core
          part of team work and making yourself relatable to others, if you
          don’t understand what you value then it becomes a lot harder to
          understand difficulties for others. There’s a lot of knowledge and
          experience that other people bring to the table, and with programming
          there is infinitely more to understand than there is to know, too much
          for a single person. Due to this I believe teamwork is a key strength
          that developers need to nurture as we are then able to work together
          and be effective.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I was surprised by how much other people struggled with the work and
          how much I felt able to help. The listening and looping exercises and
          weekly check-ins have been a place for me to gain insight into the
          other students in the cohort and I’ve really enjoyed being able to put
          myself out there to assist them. I originally had planned to come to
          this course to put my head down and keep focused on my own work and
          problems but these social interactions have made me really care for
          others and also opened the door to learn from and share this
          experience with them, something I’ve cherished so far.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
          I'ts been quite confronting to be reminded how much I’ve changed since
          the last time I did real internal reflections in my day to day life.
          In the beginning I found it quite difficult to accurately reflect on
          an entire days work and think about how each moment felt. I struggled
          to complete my blog posts and felt really insecure about taking longer
          than others and it fostered a fear that I would be a burden on
          students when we get to group work. However, in the last few weeks
          I’ve really been able to overcome that. Being intentional about having
          a positive inner talk, being social and not comparing myself to others
          has allowed me to focus on what I’m learning and gain a level of
          self-confidence in what I'm doing.

        <h2>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          From discussions I’ve had with friends and also my experience working
          in IT previously I know there can be a large lack of personal skills
          in development spaces. I think doing the core work is so key to
          changing that for future generations of the workforce, I think as well
          that the adage that you can teach anyone to code so you should hire
          for how they will work with others rings true and I believe this is
          why Dev Academy puts an emphasis on these core skills as they want to
          prepare us for the workforce as well as inspire a love of coding.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I refute any idea that the core learning was a waste of time. I think
          without the reflections, without the time spent highlighting the
          importance of personal skills, self awareness and knowing that you can
          always learn, I would not have been able to handle the stresses that
          came with trying and failing a lot of the coding challenges. I believe
          that the core skills are well placed and spaced throughout the
          program, as the coding challenges become harder and the learning
          concepts become more complex the core learnings were right there to
          support negative feelings and give you the tools to make them positive
          ones.
