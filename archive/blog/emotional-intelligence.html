        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is knowledge of yourself and others, the
          feelings and emotions that drive us and the ability to measure and
          control your actions in spite of those feelings. To have a high EQ is
          to be able to empathise with others and act with compassion, to
          understand the driving factors behind your own negative emotions
          (anxiety, anger, stress etc.) and to calm yourself and counter the
          negative effects of those feelings. EQ is self control, confidence and
          a path to a happy and intentional life.
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          IQ is the ability to the think analytically and solve problems using
          reasoning. EQ is the ability to use reasoning to explain problems that
          present themselves and to think compassionately. While these are both
          measures of intelligence and both have elements that help solve
          problems these abilities are applied in different ways. A defining
          example of their difference is for example, logic vs feeling. Logical
          problem solving uses plans and strategies to understand abstract
          ideas, to form solutions that focus on the problem that is presented
          using linear thinking, a process that sets a starting point and
          follows a connected series of actions ultimately resulting in a
          solution. Problem solving using feeling is a form of lateral thinking,
          an indirect and creative approach that focuses on factors affecting a
          problem before designing a solution. In many cases where a problem is
          socially rooted it is important to be able to use lateral thinking or
          EQ to form a solution to maintain good working relationships and
          positively impact people with solutions.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Years ago I read a book named “Notes from the End of Everything” by
          Robert Pantano. While the book is authored by Rob Pantano it is
          actually a curation of notes from another philosophical novelists
          notes as his mind declined through terminal brain cancer, John Gallo.
          While the book is 100 pages and one sentence long it took me a month
          to finish reading and a month longer to finish digesting emotionally.
          I’ve never read a book that made me believe in nihilism quite like
          this one. The first time I read the book it completely changed my
          outlook on life as it has an extremely pessimistic tone. However, it
          was through processing this book though that I learnt how powerful
          having a strong EQ was. I’ve read it a few times since and actually
          now understand the message of the book is quite the opposite, it's a
          warning to be reflective, to be honest and to be aware of yourself and
          your inner self. There’s a quote in the book that I cherish, it goes -
          “Sometimes we need to listen to happy music to feel good. And
          sometimes we need to listen to sad music to feel good. Sometimes we
          need cliches of motivation and positivity. And sometimes we need to
          face the bleaker realities to understand what we might actually be.”
        </p>
        <p>
          To get to my point, why is EQ important? When I read Notes from the
          end of everything for the first time it was early days on my journey
          of developing emotional intelligence, I wasn’t very reflective and I
          was mostly reactive to the world around me and the way I was
          experiencing it. I’m a sensitive guy and living that way was
          incredibly detrimental to my long term goals and my relationships with
          the people around me. I was taken out of commission and walked around
          like a nihilistic zombie for nearly two months because of a book that
          was only 100 pages and one sentence long. As time has gone on and my
          understanding of myself has gotten better however I’ve learnt to
          measure my responses, be more aware of the way stimulus affects my day
          to day behaviour and actually explore life as I experience it for more
          than what it is at face value. The ability to first understand your
          own behaviour and your own reactions to confrontations, pessimistic
          outlooks and arguments allows you to go forward in life and understand
          the difficulty that others are experiencing and empathise, be
          compassionate and resolve these problems with kindness and
          understanding. Emotional intelligence at its core is a tool that keeps
          you motivated and on track for your own goals and ideals and allows
          you to stay honest to your values. Emotional intelligence gives you
          the ability to overcome challenges with others and build strong
          connections and relationships with intentionality.
