          Imagine this. You’re a peak-performance athlete, dedicated to pushing
          your physical limits. In your latest training session, a sudden
          equipment failure shatters your hip, leaving you bed-bound in a
          hospital. The once rhythmic pounding of your feet on the track is
          replaced by the hum of medical machinery. Surgeries and months of
          rehabilitative physiotherapy loom ahead. You’re faced with the
          daunting task of adjusting your diet to account for the sudden loss of
          activity, and uncertainty clouds your thoughts as you question whether
          you'll ever run and train with the same intensity again.
          <br />
          Decades of medical advancements have taught us the art of
          rehabilitation and therapy for the body. We've honed the ability to
          treat minor injuries, viewing them as temporary setbacks. However,
          when confronted with major injuries, precision, discipline, and a
          laser focus on optimal outcomes become imperative. In this realm of
          physical recovery, we have learned to embrace the tenets of
          rehabilitation.
          <br />
          And yet, in the broader scope of human well-being, the principles of
          rehabilitation extend beyond the physical. Enter the realm of
          neuroplasticity – the brain's ability to reorganise itself, forging
          new neural connections throughout life.
          <br />
          In this context, poor time management, stress sensitivity, and
          negative self talk are all like the minor injuries our body might
          experience when training. The daunting factor with these is that they
          start out minor but when left untreated over long periods of time turn
          into more severe and harder to fix problems for people, developing
          into chronic procrastination, burnout and low self-eseteem.
          <br />
          Neuroplasticity makes us aware of our brains ability to change these
          habits and start treating and rehabilitating them. When we try new
          things and focus on the way we do them our brain begins to build new
          neural pathways, when we do this intentionally over a period of time
          the old pathways begin to weaken, much like roads. We have seen it
          time and time again, when a new major road opens with lots of space
          and higher speed limits people begin to use these roads as a mainstay
          of their daily commute. Take transmission gulley as an example, it has
          only been open for a couple of years now but we can already see the
          impact it has had on the old statehighway 1, the old highway is almost
          deprived of traffic. This is the same thing that happens when we flip
          our mindset. If you are able to adjust your negative self talk even
          just in a minor way, you can train your brain to feed your positive
          messages, instead of “I can’t do this” try adding “yet…” to the end of
          that sentence, within a week you might find yourself more focused,
          more positive and more composed when facing challenges in your daily
          study routine.
          <br />
          Here are the principles of neuroplasticity:

          <br />
          In the landscape of mental health, acknowledging and embracing
          neuroplasticity is akin to fine-tuning the body after a significant
          injury. It's an investment in mental well-being, fostering resilience,
          adaptability, and a profound capacity for growth. Just as an injured
          athlete diligently follows a rehabilitation regimen, engaging with
          neuroplasticity involves intentional and targeted mental exercises.

          Now with what we’ve learnt about Neuroplasticity, we understand that
          our brain can change, that we can train bad habits into good habits
          and that everyone is capable of this, how do we put it to work?
          <br />
          Well first i’d recommend having a quick watch of this
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1CHPnZfFmU">

          <br />
          The first step towards moving from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset
          is having a fundamental understanding of your neuroplasticity. A
          growth mindset is the ability to view your mistakes and setbacks as an
          opportunity to improve and do it better the next time. When you have a
          growth mindset you can look forward to challenging tasks because you
          know that through practise and repetition you will improve.
          <br />
          Ask yourself this:
        </p>
        <span>
          <ul>
            <li>How do you react when you hit a wall?</li>
            <li>
              How do you take responsibility when you’ve made a bad decision?
            </li>
            <li>How do you implement feedback into your next step?</li>
          </ul>
        </span>
        <p>
          For me I plan to have an intentional attitude towards my learning. I
          plan to define my growth mindset by how I navigate the stepping stones
          that present themselves on my learning journey, I know some may be
          harder to reach and some may be easy to fall back from or I might
          simply hit a few deadends, I am committed to not giving up and I will
          strive to continue to progress improve, particularly with my creative
          skills, it was pretty awesome to be shown a video when researching
          this about mental vs physical training and there’s real research that
          backs the practise of these things. That your imagination is actually
          linked to your physical ability and your ability to be more
          imaginative can be developed the same way you can develop your
          physical body.
