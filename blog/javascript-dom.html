        <h2>HTML, CSS & Javascript together.</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine building a webpage is like growing a tree;
          <br />
          HTML (Structure): Think of HTML as the tree's trunk. It provides the
          basic structure and foundation for the tree. Just like the trunk
          supports the branches, HTML forms the backbone of your web page,
          defining it's essential elements and layout.
          <br />
          CSS (Style): Now, envision CSS as the tree's leaves and flowers which
          attract the attention of people, birds and insects. CSS is responsible
          for the aesthetics and presentation. With CSS, you can control the
          colours, fonts, spacing and overall visual style of your web page.
          <br />
          Javascript (Behaviour): Lastly, consider JavaScript as the tree's
          lifeforce - that allows the tree to adapt and respond to its
          environment. To grow back branches when a storm rips through it, to
          expand root systems when water is scarce during a drought, or to shed
          it's leaves in winter and grow them back when it becomes summer.
          Javascript adds interactivity and dynamic behaviour to your website,
          enabling features like animations, user input handling, and real-time
          updates. It's the dynamic force that brings your web page to life.
          <br />
          Just as a healthy tree needs a strong trunk, vibrant leaves, and a
          dynamic interplay with the environment, a well-designed website
          requires a solid HTML structure, appealing CSS styling, and
          interactive JavaScript functionality to provide users with an
          enjoyable and seamless experience. The HTML forms the foundation, CSS
          enhances the visual aesthetics, and JavaScript adds the dynamic and
          responsive elements, creating a digital ecosystem that captivates and
          engages visitors, much like the harmony between a tree's trunk,
          leaves, and roots in nature.

        <h2>Flow Control and Loops explained:</h2>
        <p>
          Control Flow:
          <br />
          Scenario: You have a pile of laundry and you need to decide the
          sequence of steps to get it all cleaned and sorted.
          <br />
          Control flow is like creating a set of instructions that dictate the
          order in which tasks are performed. For exampled, you might decide the
          first step is to sort the laundry, then load it into the washing
          machine, take it from the washing machine and hanging it out to dry,
          and then finally bring it inside to fold (leaving it in a pile)
          <img src="../images/javascript-dom/CF-pseudocode.PNG" />
          <br />
          Here, the 'if-else' statements represents the control flow. If the
          laundry is dirty, perform the washing steps; otherwise, skip directly
          to folding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loops:
          <br />
          Scenario: You have seperate piles of white and colored clothes, and
          you want to repeat the same washing and drying steps for each pile.
          <br />
          Loops are like a repeated set of instructions. In the Laundry scenario
          you can use a loop to wash, dry and fold each pile of clothes without
          writing the same code multiple times.
          <img src="../images/javascript-dom/loop-pseudocode.PNG" />
          <br />
          The loop here allows you to iterate through each pile of laundry,
          performing the same set of actions for each one. It saves you from
          duplicating the code for white cloths and colored clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control flow helps you define the order of operations based on
          conditions and loops enable you to repeat a set of actions for
          multiple items or scenarios. In the context of sorting out the large
          pile of clothes sitting on my couch, control flow helps me decide what
          needs to be washed or not, and loops will let me efficiently process
          each pile of laundry with the same set of steps
        </p>
        <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM), is an interface that represents the
          structure everything that you see inside your browser as a tree of
          objects. The Document is the HTML file and the objects represents the
          elements, attributes and text within that document. The DOM provides a
          way for developers to manipulate the structure, style and content of a
          web page dynamically.
          <br />
          Below is a simple view of what the DOM would look like:
          <br />
          <img src="../images/javascript-dom/DOM_js_72.webp" />
          <br />
          Here's a brief explanation of how you might interact with the DOM
          using JavaScript:
          <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Accessing Elements: You can use Javascript to select and manipulate
            HTML elements on a web page. For example, if you have na HTML
            element with an ID of "myElement", you can access is using the
            follwoing JavaSciprt code: var element =
            document.getElementById("myElement");
          </li>
          <li>
            Modifying Content: Once you have access to an element you can modify
            its content. For instance, you can change the text inside a
            paragraph element: element.innerHTML = "new content here!";
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing Styles: JavaScript allows you to dynamically change the
            styles of HTML elements. You might alter the colour of a heading,
            for example: element.style.color= "blue";
          </li>
          <li>
            Event Handling: The DOM enables you to respond to user actions, also
            known as event listening, such as clicks or key presses. For example
            a button being clicked: button.addEventListener("click",
            function());
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Interacting with the DOM allows developers to create dynamic and
          responsive web pages by manipulating the content and structure based
          on user actions or other events.
        </p>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects.</h2>
        <p>
          Arrays and Objects are containers for storing information. They are
          similar but not the same.
          <br />
          Arrays: Are like simple containers for holding a list (or array) of
          items. Each item in the list is assigned a number called an index,
          starting at 0 and counting upwards through the list in order.
          <br />
          Objects: Are containers that can group information together using keys
          for each item inside them. Think of it like a contact in your phone
          that contains a person's name, their number, and address â€“ each piece
          of information is associated with a specific key.
          <br />
          To paint a picture to help understand the difference between these two
          and how information is accessed consider this;
          <br />
          Arrays: Imagine you have a shopping bag (Array) filled with fruit.
          Each piece of fruit (item) is numbered in the bag in the order is it
          put in. As you've gone through the super market you have grabbed (in
          order), an apple, a banana, a pear, and an orange. If you then wanted
          to retrieve the pear you'd need to say "I want the fruit at position 2
          (remember the apple is 0 as we start counting there)", and you would
          get the third item or the pear from your bag.
          <br />
          Objects: Now, think of a shopping trolley (Object) where you've
          organized different types of groceries. Each grocery item has its own
          tag or label (key). For instance, you have a "Fruits" section in your
          trolley, and under that you find an apple with the label saying
          "type:apple". So to get the apple, you'd say, "I want the fruit with
          the label 'Type" being 'Apple' from my trolley.
        </p>
        <h2>Functions.</h2>
        <p>
          Functions are the bread and butter behind the power of JavaScript.
          They are versatile ways to complete specific tasks. In essence, you
          tell a function what it is and what it does, and then call it when you
          need it to perform it's task.
          <br />
          Let's take for example baking. Now imagine you have a baking robot
          that bakes for you everytime you give it instructions, You give it a
          set of steps to make something, and it goes ahead and bakes it.
          <br />
          If you had to tell your robot everytime you wanted a cake, to measure
          out flour, then measure baking powder and add it to the flour, and
          then cream butter and sugar together, and so on and so forth to make a
          cake it could open you up to a whole range of errors. What if you
          forgot to tell it to preheat the over, or you misspoke and it grabbed
          flowers from your garden instead of flour. Your super handy baking
          robot might become more of a nuisance than a help.
          <br />
          This is where having a recipe comes in handy. If you wrote the
          insructions for baking a cake into a recipe and all you had to when
          you wanted a cake was to give your robot the recipe, it might just be
          that you get a perfect cake every single time. Similarly, a function
          is like a recipe in programming. You define the steps and give it a
          name, like "bakeCake". When you want to bake a cake, you call the
          function by it's name, and your little robot knows to follow those
          steps.
          <br />
          Functions save time and make your code more organized, they can be
          called on as needed and allow for more complex tasks to be made.
          (Imagine if our robot didn't have a prebuilt set of instructions for
          measuring, whisking, pouring and cracking eggs. We're lucky those
          methods are prebuilt in.)
