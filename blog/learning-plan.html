      What is your long term goal or career pathway? In the past my biggest wall
      for career development in the IT sector was a lack of technical
      foundations. While I had the organisational and soft skills required to
      help me excel and translate technical information across teams using
      anecdotal metaphors I was weakest when encountering technical jargon and
      concepts. My long term goal is to be well positioned as a developer that
      excels in a technical aspect, my hope is that combining my innate soft
      skills I can be reach a senior position and effective leader. A
      description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      Strengths: My strengths lie in my eye for detail, my problem solving
      skills and my work ethic. I have a good natural aptitude for learning and
      enjoy working hard. My eye for detail helps me notice mistakes as I make
      them and spot challenges/issues ahead of time and helps me stay focused on
      the task at hand. I enjoy solving problems and challenges and even create
      some for myself. Solving these problems teaches me more and reinforces
      that foundational information I’ve learnt. Limitations: One of my major
      strengths is also a weakness, as I can foresee problems ahead of time or
      understand challenges before they’re presented I often fixate on trying to
      solve those before completing the task at hand. This can be quite time
      consuming and become a distraction which actually weakens the
      understanding of what I’m trying to learn in the present because I’m too
      fixated on the future. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would
      you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? I’d really
      like to grow my creativity and innovation skills, I often find that is
      where I struggle the most. I break down problems as logic quite often and
      so my solutions are generally the most direct path or the most efficient
      path and rarely something that is creative or new that could be the most
      enjoyable way to solve the problem. A commitment to how you will manage
      your workload in this programme. This should include: I will stick to my
      time plan and keep using time tracking tools to make sure I’m giving
      myself the breaks I need to stay focused on what I’m learning. I’m
      committed to being available and involved in the cohort discord and
      keeping an eye on how people are doing. I’ve been quick to ask for help
      when I’m feeling like I need a hint or a push and I have a fantastic
      support system in place outside of the course which has helped to keep the
      emotional pressure of the work from getting to me. A commitment as to how
      and where you will seek help in a timely way When I’m feeling lost and
      down the rabbit hole I will seek out help from my homegroup and
      facilitator. I can also discuss my challenges and the help I received/how
      I solved problems with my friends and family who are developers and IT
      professionals to strengthen my learning and understand more solutions. A
      description of what you expect from the Facilitation team My expectation
      is for a kind and involved team that is available to help and support. Any
      scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to
      other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school
      drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. My brother’s wedding is on the
      16th March 2024 during bootcamp. I will need
