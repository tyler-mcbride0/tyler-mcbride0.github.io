      # Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now. When I was saving to make
      sure I was financially safe with good emergency savings and lifestyle
      savings to come to DevAcademy I was had to make the decision between
      buying my partner an expensive Christmas gift (their own car) that I would
      have loved to give them or being more finanically realistic and
      sacrificing a lot of my freetime outside of work for a different gift that
      I think they would enjoy as much (completing a meaningful piece of
      woodworking). In the short term buying the car was a big financial expense
      close to starting this course and it would have made me nervous and
      unsettled and also introduce a new financial risk when I was about to be
      foregoing my income. On the other hand the woodworking project was costly
      on my time and meant that I had to sacrifice social time with friends and
      some time I had planned to have set for preparation for this course which
      could risk my effectiveness to get out the gate heading back into study as
      my best self. In the long term I believe both gifts would have had similar
      impact emotionally, the car would have been theirs but it was a purchase
      for us and the woodworking was something that could be cherished by both
      of us as a representation of my love for them at this point in my life.
      Also financially the car introduced risk and some negative emotions
      attached to my feeling of financial security and the woodworking presented
      no financial cost. In the end I decided to sacrifice my time rather than
      my finances, I knew that having to sacrifice time away from my friends and
      family in the lead up to Christmas would be difficult but there would
      still be some time between then and the start of this course to savour,
      similarly I knew that I could refactor my time plan to prepare for this
      course and adjust it within the break to play a little bit of catch up and
      reduce the risk of starting slow. I'm very happy with the decision I made,
      knowing that we can still commit to purchasing a new car after this course
      and that they adored the gift was a win. It also made the moments I spent
      with them, my family and friends over the break even more important and
      cherished. # Describe how your culture and the people around you have
      influenced your values and identity. I am from a large family, 2 sisters,
      3 brothers, 2 mums, 1 dad and an absolute cohort of family that's not
      blood related attached to all of that. It has made me a caring, kind and
      settled person who is sure of myself and loyal to a fault with those I
      hold dear. # Identify your strengths and how they will support you during
      your learning journey. My key strengths: - Intelligent: Both Logically and
      Emotionally, I have a good aptitude for understanding what I'm learning
      and the personal skills to explain and work well with others. - Problem
      Solving: I've been taught to think critically my whole life, sometimes to
      a fault of overthinking but it has served me well to be an effective
      problem solver. - Detail Oriented: I have a keen eye for detail and often
      forsee mistakes before they happen and am good at reviewing my work and
      checking it as I go. - Work Horse: I enjoy working and being put to work,
      I always have multiple things on the go at a time and enjoy life most when
      it's busy. This will keep me up to date and ahead of the workload while
      learning. # Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey? My main
      limitations: - Forward-Thinking: I often become preoccupied with the
      future, this comes at the expense of what's happenning right now and can
      cause frustration in group settings as I have a habit of expecting others
      to forsee problems the same way I do. - Overly Accomodating: I can be
      quite passive when working on a solution, while I work well with others I
      often end up a 2IC rather than a leader and often avoid conflict at all
      costs even if it means taking more time or working through sub-optimal
      solutions. - Easily Distracted: I am easily distracted as I often have
      multiple things on the go, I do have a lot of boundaries/plans in place to
      been me focused and prioritise things but am only human and can be swayed
      outside of my guides depending. # Share an example of when you were trying
      to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
      Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
      your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why. When
      I was training my replacement in my previous job the person taking over my
      role was significantly older and more experienced than me. While I help my
      quality of work in high esteem and while training him tried to convey how
      much I had iterated and developed my working process to be highly
      effecient he preferred a different approach to the responsibilities of the
      job. This caused a bit of resistence, especially culturally as my role
      interacted with every other area of the business and had influence on my
      colleagues ability to do their jobs well. To counter this tension, I took
      my replacement for a coffee and we had a discussion about how we can
      adjust the training and I spent time explaining why I worked the way I
      worked, he shared his experience and what he was confident in and not
      confident in and we adjusted the plan so that we weren't wasting time on
      teaching him basics he already understood and instead of focused on the
      workflow and how we get to solutions. If I were to be in a similar
      situation in the future I would do the plan collaboratively from the
      beginning instead of thinking of a plan ahead of time and applying it
      directly to them, this would have prevented the frustrations and set my
      replacement up for success with the rest of the team rather than starting
      them on the back foot and asking them to treat him with grace while he
      figured out the job.
