              <p>
                Imagine this. You’re a peak-performance athlete, dedicated to
                pushing your physical limits. In your latest training session, a
                sudden equipment failure shatters your hip, leaving you
                bed-bound in a hospital. The once rhythmic pounding of your feet
                on the track is replaced by the hum of medical machinery.
                Surgeries and months of rehabilitative physiotherapy loom ahead.
                You’re faced with the daunting task of adjusting your diet to
                account for the sudden loss of activity, and uncertainty clouds
                your thoughts as you question whether you'll ever run and train
                with the same intensity again.
                <br />
                Decades of medical advancements have taught us the art of
                rehabilitation and therapy for the body. We've honed the ability
                to treat minor injuries, viewing them as temporary setbacks.
                However, when confronted with major injuries, precision,
                discipline, and a laser focus on optimal outcomes become
                imperative. In this realm of physical recovery, we have learned
                to embrace the tenets of rehabilitation.
                <br />
                And yet, in the broader scope of human well-being, the
                principles of rehabilitation extend beyond the physical. Enter
                the realm of neuroplasticity – the brain's ability to reorganise
                itself, forging new neural connections throughout life.
                <br />
                In this context, poor time management, stress sensitivity, and
                negative self talk are all like the minor injuries our body
                might experience when training. The daunting factor with these
                is that they start out minor but when left untreated over long
                periods of time turn into more severe and harder to fix problems
                for people, developing into chronic procrastination, burnout and
                low self-eseteem.
                <br />
                Neuroplasticity makes us aware of our brains ability to change
                these habits and start treating and rehabilitating them. When we
                try new things and focus on the way we do them our brain begins
                to build new neural pathways, when we do this intentionally over
                a period of time the old pathways begin to weaken, much like
                roads. We have seen it time and time again, when a new major
                road opens with lots of space and higher speed limits people
                begin to use these roads as a mainstay of their daily commute.
                Take transmission gulley as an example, it has only been open
                for a couple of years now but we can already see the impact it
                has had on the old statehighway 1, the old highway is almost
                deprived of traffic. This is the same thing that happens when we
                flip our mindset. If you are able to adjust your negative self
                talk even just in a minor way, you can train your brain to feed
                your positive messages, instead of “I can’t do this” try adding
                “yet…” to the end of that sentence, within a week you might find
                yourself more focused, more positive and more composed when
                facing challenges in your daily study routine.
                <br />
                Here are the principles of neuroplasticity:
                <br />

                /></a>
                <br />
                In the landscape of mental health, acknowledging and embracing
                neuroplasticity is akin to fine-tuning the body after a
                significant injury. It's an investment in mental well-being,
                fostering resilience, adaptability, and a profound capacity for
                growth. Just as an injured athlete diligently follows a
                rehabilitation regimen, engaging with neuroplasticity involves
                intentional and targeted mental exercises.

                Now with what we’ve learnt about Neuroplasticity, we understand
                that our brain can change, that we can train bad habits into
                good habits and that everyone is capable of this, how do we put
                it to work?
                <br />
                Well first i’d recommend having a quick watch of this

                The first step towards moving from a fixed mindset to a growth
                mindset is having a fundamental understanding of your
                neuroplasticity. A growth mindset is the ability to view your
                mistakes and setbacks as an opportunity to improve and do it
                better the next time. When you have a growth mindset you can
                look forward to challenging tasks because you know that through
                practise and repetition you will improve.
                <br />
                Ask yourself this:
              </p>
              <span>
                <ul>
                  <li>How do you react when you hit a wall?</li>
                  <li>
                    How do you take responsibility when you’ve made a bad
                    decision?
                  </li>
                  <li>How do you implement feedback into your next step?</li>
                </ul>
              </span>
              <p>
                For me I plan to have an intentional attitude towards my
                learning. I plan to define my growth mindset by how I navigate
                the stepping stones that present themselves on my learning
                journey, I know some may be harder to reach and some may be easy
                to fall back from or I might simply hit a few deadends, I am
                committed to not giving up and I will strive to continue to
                progress improve, particularly with my creative skills, it was
                pretty awesome to be shown a video when researching this about
                mental vs physical training and there’s real research that backs
                the practise of these things. That your imagination is actually
                linked to your physical ability and your ability to be more
                imaginative can be developed the same way you can develop your
                physical body.
