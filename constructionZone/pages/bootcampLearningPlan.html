              <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
              <p>
                In the past my biggest challenge for career development in the
                IT sector was a lack of technical foundations. While I had the
                organisational and soft skills required to help me excel and
                translate technical information across teams using anecdotal
                metaphors I was weakest when encountering technical jargon and
                concepts. My long term goal is to be well positioned as a
                developer that excels in a technical aspect, my hope is that
                combining my innate soft skills I can be reach a senior position
                and effective leader.
              </p>
              <h2>
                A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
                learning
              </h2>
              <p>
                Strengths: My strengths lie in my eye for detail, my problem
                solving skills and my work ethic. I have a good natural aptitude
                for learning and enjoy working hard. My eye for detail helps me
                notice mistakes as I make them and spot challenges/issues ahead
                of time and helps me stay focused on the task at hand. I enjoy
                solving problems and challenges and even create some for myself.
                Solving these problems teaches me more and reinforces that
                foundational information I’ve learnt. Limitations: One of my
                major strengths is also a weakness, as I can foresee problems
                ahead of time or understand challenges before they’re presented
                I often fixate on trying to solve those before completing the
                task at hand. This can be quite time consuming and become a
                distraction which actually weakens the understanding of what I’m
                trying to learn in the present because I’m too fixated on the
                future.
              </p>
              <h2>
                What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
                see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I’d really like to grow my creativity and innovation skills, I
                often find that is where I struggle the most. I break down
                problems as logic quite often and so my solutions are generally
                the most direct path or the most efficient path and rarely
                something that is creative or new that could be the most
                enjoyable way to solve the problem.
              </p>
              <h2>
                A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
                programme. This should include:
              </h2>
              <p>
                I will stick to my time plan and keep using time tracking tools
                to make sure I’m giving myself the breaks I need to stay focused
                on what I’m learning. I’m committed to being available and
                involved in the cohort discord and keeping an eye on how people
                are doing. I’ve been quick to ask for help when I’m feeling like
                I need a hint or a push and I have a fantastic support system in
                place outside of the course which has helped to keep the
                emotional pressure of the work from getting to me.
              </p>
              <h2>
                A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
                way
              </h2>
              <p>
                When I’m feeling lost and down the rabbit hole I will seek out
                help from my homegroup and facilitator. I can also discuss my
                challenges and the help I received/how I solved problems with my
                friends and family who are developers and IT professionals to
                strengthen my learning and understand more solutions.
              </p>
              <h2>
                A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
              </h2>
              <p>
                My expectation is for a kind and involved team that is available
                to help and support.
              </p>
              <h2>
                Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
                committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
                commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these
                in.
              </h2>
              <p>
                My brother’s wedding is on the 16th March 2024 during bootcamp.
                I will need to plan around missing a day of focused study and
                work ahead of time for this.
