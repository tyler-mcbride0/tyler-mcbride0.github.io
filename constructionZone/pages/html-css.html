              <h2>The Basics</h2>
              <p>
                Elements in HTML have properties that help define the space they
                take up on a webpage, these properties are known as the padding,
                border and margin of the element.
              </p>
              <p>But hold up, let’s backtrack quickly, what is an element.</p>
              <p>
                Element’s are the building blocks that HTML uses to put content
                on a webpage. Every piece of content then takes up space on your
                page and the browser then displays it how it is told to by your
                HTML document and stylesheet (we’re using CSS in this example).
              </p>
              <img src="../images/html-css/MBPC Diagram.PNG" />
              <p>
                This is an example of those four regions of the element. The
                blue area is grossly out of scale but indicates the content of
                the element. The green area is the padding, the space between
                the content of the element and its border. The yellow area is
                the border, the space between the padding and the margin of the
                element. Finally the brown area is the margin, the space between
                an element’s border and another element.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s explore this a little bit below with an example element
                like this image of some pohutukawa flowers.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG" />
              <h2>Borders, explained.</h2>
              <p>
                Let’s start with the border. Because the border can be styled
                visually it is a lot easier to visualise it, because we can see
                it.
              </p>
              <p>
                To start with we’re going to add a 20px border, we will give it
                the same yellow colour as the diagram above and make it a solid
                border.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/html-css/Border-Code.PNG" />
              <img src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG" id="border" />
              <p>
                See how our image above has gained this big yellow line around
                the edge of it. This is what is controlled by the border
                property in css.
              </p>
              <h2>Padding, explained.</h2>
              <p>
                Next up let’s look at the padding. We use padding to bulk up an
                element and it defines the space between the contents of our
                element, in this case our lovely image of pohutukawa flowers,
                and the border (the thick yellow line we made show earlier).
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s see what happens when we add padding of 20px to our image.
              </p>
              <img src="../images/html-css/padding-code.PNG" />
              <img
                src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG"
                id="padding"
                class="progress1"
              />
              <p>
                See how there is now a green space that’s shown up. This is the
                padding that we’ve added. A fun part of border, margin and
                padding is that their size can be adjusted on each side. This is
                done by defining the property and then the side ie.
                padding-left: 35px; will adjust the left hand padding to 35
                pixels wide. Below I’ve adjusted the top, right, bottom and left
                padding to demonstrate this.
              </p>
              <img
                src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG"
                id="padding2"
                class="progress1"
              />
              <h2>Margins, explained.</h2>
              <p>
                Lastly, margins help control the space outside of our element’s
                border and the other element’s on our page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let’s add a second Pohutukawa picture to better show this and
                adjust the margin size to demonstrate how this could be useful
                (I’ve also done a little bit of background magic so we can see
                the brown area and treat it like the margins in this case as the
                margin doesn't hold onto colours)
              </p>
              <img src="../images/html-css/margin-code.PNG" />
              <div class="fakemargin">
                <img
                  src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG"
                  id="margin"
                  class="progress2"
                />
                <img
                  src="../images/html-css/Pohutukawa.PNG"
                  id="margin"
                  class="progress2"
                />
              </div>
              <p>
                To extend on from the point at the end of padding about being
                able to adjust the top, sides and bottom of these properties
                there is a shorthand way of writing this in CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is simply by defining the property and then typing the
                values in a clockwise order, ie. margin: 5px 10px 20px 15px;
                will set the margin top to 5 pixels, right side to 10pixels,
                bottom to 20 pixels and the left margin to 15pixels.
              </p>
              <h2>Final Point.</h2>
              <p>
                In conclusion, understanding the use of margins, padding, and
                borders in HTML is essential for controlling the layout and
                spacing of elements on a webpage. Margins define the space
                outside an element's border, allowing for control over the
                separation between elements. Padding is employed to adjust the
                space between an element's content and its border, providing
                flexibility and aesthetic appeal. Borders, both visually
                styleable and structurally defining, contribute to the overall
                presentation of elements. By mastering these fundamental
                concepts, web developers can craft well-organised and visually
                appealing layouts, enhancing the user experience on their
                websites.
