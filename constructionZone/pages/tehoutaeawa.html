              <h2>
                A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest
                runner.
              </h2>
              <p>
                Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many
                pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted
                kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to
                the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch
                the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for
                Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived
                there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like
                the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te
                Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a
                good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went
                straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet
                potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
              </p>
              <p>
                "While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was
                spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.
