              <h2>HTML, CSS & Javascript together.</h2>
              <p>
                Imagine building a webpage is like growing a tree;
                <br />
                HTML (Structure): Think of HTML as the tree's trunk. It provides
                the basic structure and foundation for the tree. Just like the
                trunk supports the branches, HTML forms the backbone of your web
                page, defining it's essential elements and layout.
                <br />
                CSS (Style): Now, envision CSS as the tree's leaves and flowers
                which attract the attention of people, birds and insects. CSS is
                responsible for the aesthetics and presentation. With CSS, you
                can control the colours, fonts, spacing and overall visual style
                of your web page.
                <br />
                Javascript (Behaviour): Lastly, consider JavaScript as the
                tree's lifeforce - that allows the tree to adapt and respond to
                its environment. To grow back branches when a storm rips through
                it, to expand root systems when water is scarce during a
                drought, or to shed it's leaves in winter and grow them back
                when it becomes summer. Javascript adds interactivity and
                dynamic behaviour to your website, enabling features like
                animations, user input handling, and real-time updates. It's the
                dynamic force that brings your web page to life.
                <br />
                Just as a healthy tree needs a strong trunk, vibrant leaves, and
                a dynamic interplay with the environment, a well-designed
                website requires a solid HTML structure, appealing CSS styling,
                and interactive JavaScript functionality to provide users with
                an enjoyable and seamless experience. The HTML forms the
                foundation, CSS enhances the visual aesthetics, and JavaScript
                adds the dynamic and responsive elements, creating a digital
                ecosystem that captivates and engages visitors, much like the
                harmony between a tree's trunk, leaves, and roots in nature.
              </p>
              <h2>Flow Control and Loops explained:</h2>
              <p>
                Control Flow:
                <br />
                Scenario: You have a pile of laundry and you need to decide the
                sequence of steps to get it all cleaned and sorted.
                <br />
                Control flow is like creating a set of instructions that dictate
                the order in which tasks are performed. For exampled, you might
                decide the first step is to sort the laundry, then load it into
                the washing machine, take it from the washing machine and
                hanging it out to dry, and then finally bring it inside to fold
                (leaving it in a pile)
                <img src="../images/javascript-dom/CF-pseudocode.PNG" />
                <br />
                Here, the 'if-else' statements represents the control flow. If
                the laundry is dirty, perform the washing steps; otherwise, skip
                directly to folding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loops:
                <br />
                Scenario: You have seperate piles of white and colored clothes,
                and you want to repeat the same washing and drying steps for
                each pile.
                <br />
                Loops are like a repeated set of instructions. In the Laundry
                scenario you can use a loop to wash, dry and fold each pile of
                clothes without writing the same code multiple times.
                <img src="../images/javascript-dom/loop-pseudocode.PNG" />
                <br />
                The loop here allows you to iterate through each pile of
                laundry, performing the same set of actions for each one. It
                saves you from duplicating the code for white cloths and colored
                clothes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Control flow helps you define the order of operations based on
                conditions and loops enable you to repeat a set of actions for
                multiple items or scenarios. In the context of sorting out the
                large pile of clothes sitting on my couch, control flow helps me
                decide what needs to be washed or not, and loops will let me
                efficiently process each pile of laundry with the same set of
                steps
              </p>
              <h2>What is the DOM?</h2>
              <p>
                The Document Object Model (DOM), is an interface that represents
                the structure everything that you see inside your browser as a
                tree of objects. The Document is the HTML file and the objects
                represents the elements, attributes and text within that
                document. The DOM provides a way for developers to manipulate
                the structure, style and content of a web page dynamically.
                <br />
                Below is a simple view of what the DOM would look like:
                <br />
                <img src="../images/javascript-dom/DOM_js_72.webp" />
                <br />
                Here's a brief explanation of how you might interact with the
                DOM using JavaScript:
                <br />
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Accessing Elements: You can use Javascript to select and
                  manipulate HTML elements on a web page. For example, if you
                  have na HTML element with an ID of "myElement", you can access
                  is using the follwoing JavaSciprt code: var element =
                  document.getElementById("myElement");
                </li>
                <li>
                  Modifying Content: Once you have access to an element you can
                  modify its content. For instance, you can change the text
                  inside a paragraph element: element.innerHTML = "new content
                  here!";
                </li>
                <li>
                  Changing Styles: JavaScript allows you to dynamically change
                  the styles of HTML elements. You might alter the colour of a
                  heading, for example: element.style.color= "blue";
                </li>
                <li>
                  Event Handling: The DOM enables you to respond to user
                  actions, also known as event listening, such as clicks or key
                  presses. For example a button being clicked:
                  button.addEventListener("click", function());
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Interacting with the DOM allows developers to create dynamic and
                responsive web pages by manipulating the content and structure
                based on user actions or other events.
              </p>
              <h2>Arrays and Objects.</h2>
              <p>
                Arrays and Objects are containers for storing information. They
                are similar but not the same.
                <br />
                Arrays: Are like simple containers for holding a list (or array)
                of items. Each item in the list is assigned a number called an
                index, starting at 0 and counting upwards through the list in
                order.
                <br />
                Objects: Are containers that can group information together
                using keys for each item inside them. Think of it like a contact
                in your phone that contains a person's name, their number, and
                address â€“ each piece of information is associated with a
                specific key.
                <br />
                To paint a picture to help understand the difference between
                these two and how information is accessed consider this;
                <br />
                Arrays: Imagine you have a shopping bag (Array) filled with
                fruit. Each piece of fruit (item) is numbered in the bag in the
                order is it put in. As you've gone through the super market you
                have grabbed (in order), an apple, a banana, a pear, and an
                orange. If you then wanted to retrieve the pear you'd need to
                say "I want the fruit at position 2 (remember the apple is 0 as
                we start counting there)", and you would get the third item or
                the pear from your bag.
                <br />
                Objects: Now, think of a shopping trolley (Object) where you've
                organized different types of groceries. Each grocery item has
                its own tag or label (key). For instance, you have a "Fruits"
                section in your trolley, and under that you find an apple with
                the label saying "type:apple". So to get the apple, you'd say,
                "I want the fruit with the label 'Type" being 'Apple' from my
                trolley.
              </p>
              <h2>Functions.</h2>
              <p>
                Functions are the bread and butter behind the power of
                JavaScript. They are versatile ways to complete specific tasks.
                In essence, you tell a function what it is and what it does, and
                then call it when you need it to perform it's task.
                <br />
                Let's take for example baking. Now imagine you have a baking
                robot that bakes for you everytime you give it instructions, You
                give it a set of steps to make something, and it goes ahead and
                bakes it.
                <br />
                If you had to tell your robot everytime you wanted a cake, to
                measure out flour, then measure baking powder and add it to the
                flour, and then cream butter and sugar together, and so on and
                so forth to make a cake it could open you up to a whole range of
                errors. What if you forgot to tell it to preheat the over, or
                you misspoke and it grabbed flowers from your garden instead of
                flour. Your super handy baking robot might become more of a
                nuisance than a help.
                <br />
                This is where having a recipe comes in handy. If you wrote the
                insructions for baking a cake into a recipe and all you had to
                when you wanted a cake was to give your robot the recipe, it
                might just be that you get a perfect cake every single time.
                Similarly, a function is like a recipe in programming. You
                define the steps and give it a name, like "bakeCake". When you
                want to bake a cake, you call the function by it's name, and
                your little robot knows to follow those steps.
                <br />
                Functions save time and make your code more organized, they can
                be called on as needed and allow for more complex tasks to be
                made. (Imagine if our robot didn't have a prebuilt set of
                instructions for measuring, whisking, pouring and cracking eggs.
                We're lucky those methods are prebuilt in.)
