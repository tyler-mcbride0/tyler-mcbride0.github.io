              <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
              <p>
                I’d like to find myself back in the IT sector, hopefully working
                in a technical role that I can use my people skills as an asset
                to strengthen the team and its relationships. I don’t have a
                particular destination in mind currently.
              </p>
              <h2>
                What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
                in Bootcamp?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I know that my ability to work with others, break the ice and
                set a standard for interactions will be a massive strength
                toward how bootcamp goes for me. I worry that I need to keep my
                confidence in check so that I don’t overwhelm or overpower those
                around me, especially when I believe they’re likely to have
                stronger technical understanding than me.
              </p>
              <h2>
                What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
                Bootcamp will be?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I’m worried about my ability to stay well focused for the next
                nine weeks, I’ve had a myriad of disruptions to foundations that
                have just been the worst timing that has unsettled my flow a
                little bit. I think I’m gaining that back and the move to
                bootcamp may be the break point I need to get that laser focus
                back.
              </p>
              <h2>
                What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
                developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
              </h2>
              <p>
                I’m really looking forward to continuing to work on my active
                listening skills, I think this is the weakest of my soft skills
                as I often find myself jumping starting to ponder solutions and
                my internal dialogue takes away from me being able to
                concentrate and listen intently to others. I’d really like to be
                able to remain present and expand on that capability without
                hurting my ability to empathise and problem solve with others.
              </p>
              <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
              <p>
                I hope they’re as great as they have been for foundations, the
                level of support and the kind hearted nature of the foundations
                team has set the bar pretty high for what I would hope
                interactions during bootcamp will look like.
              </p>
              <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
              <p>
                I think given the structured approach that bootcamp has, I think
                I will need to reach out for help sooner and let go of a lot of
                my stubbornness when it comes to poor solutions I’ve come up
                with to solve the challenges we’re presented with.
                <br />
                I am committed to keeping myself up to date with my work, to
                spend my own time to review and improve what I’ve learnt, to
                help others when they ask for it without hesitation, to listen
                to the experts and question things I don’t understand so that
                everyone gets through it.
